Project 1 

Question 1: Is there any correlation between the ages of the nominees and the winners throughout the years of the Oscars?
	-Starting with the first Academy/Oscar Awards in 1929, the average age of the nominees were right around 40 years of age, but throughout the years, the mean age has risen slowly, but still risen, nonetheless. There have not been too many duplicate nominees, but I did highlight Daniel Day-Lewis who has been nominated 5 separate times. Each year, it seems like the variance of ages of the nominees are quite high, so there are a wide variety of ages of people that get chosen.

	Question 2: Of the best director Oscars nominees, what are the differences in age and gender of the candidates?
	-You can kind of see a trend with the data. The first directors were young and increased for about 30 or so years and then the new young directors came for another 30-40 years then age trended down again. For the most part, age is consistently around the 45 year of age mark. Only 5 female directors have been nominated in the history of the awards. The male population far exceeds the female one where there are no discernable variations between the ages of the women.
