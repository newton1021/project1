# project1 - Team 3 - Analyzing the Oscars

For this project our team used a variety of resources to look at the the history of the Academy Awards Winners to see if there were correlations between the winning films and a variety of data.  We looked to see if there was any relation between winning an award with the age of the actors the age and gender of the director, the month and quarters that the movies were released, if a critics review had more impact than the general publics review, and if higher box office sales helped movies.  This data was gathered from https://www.kaggle.com/unanimad/the-oscar-award which gave us a list of the nominees and winners through from 1927-2020.  This information was used with http://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx , https://www.statista.com/statistics/1072778/highest-grossing-movie-annually-historical/, and https://www.statista.com/statistics/1072778/highest-grossing-movie-annually-historical/  to find the data needed for the analysis.   This information was used in Jupyter Notebook using the skills we have been learning through the first 6 weeks of class.  Jupyter Notebook, Python, Pandas, MatPlotLib and other skills are highlighted in this project. 

Our Analysis found the following information:


 

**Question 1:Is there any correlation between the ages of the nominees and the winners throughout the years of the Oscars?**
	
	- Starting with the first Academy/Oscar Awards in 1929, the average age of the nominees were right around 40 years of age, but throughout the years, the mean age has risen slowly, but still risen, nonetheless. There have not been too many duplicate nominees, but I did highlight Daniel Day-Lewis who has been nominated 5 separate times. Each year, it seems like the variance of ages of the nominees are quite high, so there are a wide variety of ages of people that get chosen.

**Question 2: Of the best director Oscars nominees, what are the differences in age and gender of the candidates?**
	
	- You can kind of see a trend with the data. The first directors were young and increased for about 30 or so years and then the new young directors came for another 30-40 years then age trended down again. For the most part, age is consistently around the 45 year of age mark. Only 5 female directors have been nominated in the history of the awards. The male population far exceeds the female one where there are no discernable variations between the ages of the women.


**Question 3: Does the date that the movie is released have any correlation on the chances it will win an award?**
- The answer is a resounding yes.  In doing a data compare, 41.3% of the winning films were released in the fourth quarter, with the majority being released in December.  Summer releases were the least likely to win any awards.
